# Findings

```{r}
TransferApps <- read.csv("C:/Users/christine.iyer/Box/FY21_Transfer_App_Flow/All_Transfers_Born_After_1990.csv", header = T, stringsAsFactors = F)

__Margin Figures__

Images and graphics play an integral role in Tufte's work. To place figures in the margin you can use the 

```{r fig-margin, fig.margin = TRUE, fig.cap = "MPG vs horsepower, colored by transmission.", fig.width=3.5, fig.height=3.5, cache=TRUE, message=FALSE}

colors <-  c("#F6A704", "#0E1033","#4E7B14","#A92007","#D47E0A")
mtcars2 <- mtcars
mtcars2$am <- factor(
  mtcars$am, labels = c('automatic', 'manual')
)
a_a <- ggplot(mtcars2, aes(hp, mpg, color = am)) +
  geom_point() + geom_smooth(se=FALSE ) +
  theme(legend.position = 'bottom') + theme_bw() +
    scale_color_manual(
        values=colors)
a_a
```



```{r}
imgur_image <-
   add_imgur_image(
     image = a_a,
     client_id = "851117406f0b457"
   )

```

__Save an Image to Email & Compose and Send an Email__

The plot to the side will be included in an email. 

```{r eval=FALSE, include=FALSE}


body_text <-
  glue(

The data he sent makes much more sense. \\
It was excluding students who are not yet captured \\
because the census report is a couple months away. We \\
discussed criteria for a new list which will hopefully \\ 
include students who have deposited and are due to start \\
in the upcoming months. This will give us a second year \\
of applications so we can look at the patterns of ap-\\
plication flow. He's sending the list by EOD tomorrow.
